# Bikeckeck Schema

## The Why

The bicycle industry needs a standarized ontology to achieve interoperatibility across vendors and for end-consumers to be able produce and consume product data across platforms and systems.

## The What

Bicycle part specifications do have specific atttributes that are relevant along the whole production and supply chain. By providing structured data over a shared vocabulary we are able to extend the possibilites of publishing and syndicating those specifications.


## The How

Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences.
